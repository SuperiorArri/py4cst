Additional Clarifications (non-binding; for clarity only)

These notes do not add terms or alter the MIT License. If there is any
conflict, the MIT terms above govern.

- Purpose of interoperability: This Software may be used to read, write, or
  convert third-party file formats in order to enable compatibility with other

- No third-party proprietary code: This Software contains no code copied from,
  and is not derived from, proprietary software of any third-party vendor. It
  operates only on user-generated data files.

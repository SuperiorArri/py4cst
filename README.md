# Welcome to py4cst!

This is a small python library that provides wrappers for CST Studio Suite python library as well as some useful high level tools to setup your projects and to read out the results.

**Be aware the library in it's current state is highly untested and will change a lot even in it's core. Any contributions are welcome!**

## Update 0.2.0

Added VBA mappings. VBA wrappers are now generated automatically from TOML files, including documentation.

# Usage

Check the *examples* directory.
